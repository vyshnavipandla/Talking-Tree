"""In this "polly_mmap.py" file we use boto3,pyaudio and mmap modules.
boto3 provides the access for AWS. pyaudio provides a cross-platform audio i/p & o/p interface.
mmap method is a system call that allows a process to map a file into memory.
we use the Amazon Polly SDK to synthesize speech from a text input, and store the resulting "audio_data" in a variable.
created an instance of PyAudio and an audio stream that can be used to play audio data.
"stream.write" is used to write audio data to the output device.
we created a memory-mapped file object, write the audio data to it, and stream the data to an audio output device using PyAudio.
Then closes the "pyAudio stream",terminates the "pyAudio object",close the mmap file."""
